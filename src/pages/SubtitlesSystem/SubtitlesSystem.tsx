                <strong>Subtitle System of Global Kabbalah Academy</strong>
                <p>
                    A desktop application used during live broadcasts by
                    Subtitlers, the system's primary function is to upload text
                    slides containing study materials and discussion questions.
                </p>
                <strong>Live Broadcast Features</strong>
                <p>
                    The Subtitler's focus is crucial for selecting relevant
                    text. Coordination with the broadcaster includes managing
                    subtitles and seamlessly transitioning to "Questions" mode.
                </p>
                <strong>Workshop Questions Handling</strong>
                <p>
                    During workshop queries, the Subtitler switches from
                    "Subtitles" to "Questions," confirming questions in four
                    languages. An additional button facilitates the upload of
                    slides for viewing on the learning site, and the system also
                    acts as a content repository with high storage capacity.
